# TSI DX Node
An open-source, decentralized solution for peer-to-peer data exchange among business partners.

Note: The solution is currently under development. Once we've developed the core features required for a robust Data Exchange solution, we'll provide installation instructions for you to download and try out. Meanwhile, please take a look at our [docs](https://github.com/tsi-coop/tsi-dx-node/blob/main/docs/TSI%20DX%20Node.pdf). A high level functional overview of the solution is available [here](https://techadvisory.substack.com/p/the-need-for-a-better-data-exchange).
